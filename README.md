## Motivation
I was (am) working on a[ mobile app for tracking my own spending](https://github.com/oayomide/agbowo). While there are a lot of apps out there that do this, what I needed was one that "just works". Other apps require you to input values, take pictures of your receipts, etc when using them (at least the ones I tried) and this is exhausting, gives room for "cheating" (not tracking a particular spending and thus "false positives" of your finances) and also sometimes you pay with your card online. So I decided: ***"I am going to write mine!"*** Not only would my app work great offline (no "3rd party API to user's account details and all that"), it's going to **perfectly** track my spending and I dont have to do almost anything! 🔥🔥🔥 😎


So I had the app up in no time (okay maybe not. took a while. I had to work) and then I hit a wall: **"HOW DO I RETRIEVE ALL THE INFORMATION I NEED FROM THE SMS I RECEIVE?"**. I receive both SMS and E-mail notifications of ***every*** transaction! Thus, I decided to write a "parser". I couldnt continue so I stopped temporarily.

And if you have been seeing my github recently, I have been experimenting with lexers and parsers (and sweet WebAssembly!). Using a book, I even wrote a [lexer for yorlang](https://github.com/oayomide/yl-lexer) [WIP though...no schedule]. So it made sense!


### So whats up?
Yeah this particular version is the very first version. Let me say: **ITS NOT THE BEST CODE EVER.** It basically was a way for me to put what I had in my head into code. I got something at the end and that was my aim. I am rewriting from scratch, the v2. With better ideas.

So easy on my code 🥺🙏

So please hang around. After this parser, the development of the app continues! 😎😎.
